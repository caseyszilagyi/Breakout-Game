### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications:



Known Bugs:
- When the ball hits the corner of a brick it often doesn't bounce off in the way it is supposed to.
This is due to an error in the ball bouncing logic that I couldn't quite get right.
  
- The bad power up that speeds up the ball only works occasionally.

- The paddle gets more sensitive to the arrow keys each time a new level is reached.

### Impressions

I think it was a very good assignment to help me get a grasp of JavaFX. Unfortunately it being the first assignment
I didn't navigate the course page as well as I should have and definitely missed out on looking at some resources
early on that would have been helpful. It was definitely a lot to handle for the first assignment but was a good way
to ramp me right up into coding again. I wish there was a little more guidance on what was considered more important,
and a little more emphasis on what coding practices I should be focusing on most, because I feel like there was
a lot of things I missed that I might have caught if they were mentioned in class. Unfortunately I spent
so much time coding the project that I didn't have time to go through and look at all the various
resources linked to the project.
